# 🛒 Ecommerce Recipes Microservices

A scalable **Spring Boot Microservices-based E-commerce system** built with **Docker, Kafka, and API Gateway architecture**. This project demonstrates real-world backend system design with distributed services and event-driven communication.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Spring Boot, Java
* **Architecture:** Microservices
* **API Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway
* **Service Discovery:** Eureka Server
* **Messaging:** Apache Kafka
* **Database:** (Add your DB here - MySQL / PostgreSQL / MongoDB)
* **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

## 🧩 Microservices Overview

| Service Name              | Description                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🧑 User Service           | Handles user authentication & management |
| 📦 Product/Recipe Service | Manages products/recipes                 |
| 🛒 Order Service          | Handles order creation & processing      |
| 📊 Inventory Service      | Manages stock availability               |
| 💳 Payment Service        | Handles payments                         |
| 🔔 Notification Service   | Sends notifications using Kafka          |
| 🌐 API Gateway            | Routes all client requests               |
| 🧭 Service Registry       | Eureka server for service discovery      |

## 🏗️ Architecture

```text
Client
   ↓
API Gateway
   ↓
-----------------------------
|  Order Service            |
|  Inventory Service        |
|  User Service             |
|  Recipe Service           |
|  Payment Service          |
-----------------------------
   ↓
Kafka (Event Streaming)
   ↓
Notification Service
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Client sends request via **API Gateway**
2. Gateway routes request to appropriate microservice
3. Services communicate via REST or Kafka events
4. Kafka handles asynchronous communication (e.g., order → notification)
5. Eureka manages service discovery dynamically
